# Errors and Solution

## 1. " EPERM: operation not permitted, rmdir ":

Usually happens due to permission issues, file locks, or OneDrive interference. Letâ€™s go over some possible causes and solutions.

There can be many causes for this error but which helps me a lot is 'clearing Vite's Cache'.

To clear Vite's cache run this below command in Powershell -

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules/.vite
npm cache clean --force
npm install
```
